## Commentary

This work presents **Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation and Retrodirective Beamforming**, essential for **wireless power transmission in Space-Based Solar Power (SBSP) systems**. It is part of my **MSc and PhD research**, where a **4×4 antenna array** with variable baselines was used to improve **AOA accuracy**. The **retrodirective method** eliminates synchronization issues by allowing antennas to function independently.

The **DOA Error vs. SNR script** analyzes **error vs. SNR** for different baselines. The **DOA least squares fitting script** predicts **SNR values from experimental data**, aiding **real solar power satellite applications**. The **retrodirective beamforming** script models a **1×4 patch antenna subarray**, ensuring correct phase conjugation. The **antenna deformation compensation** script corrects beam misalignment due to structural distortions.

These Python scripts are **conceptual demonstrations**, not exact research implementations, illustrating key **signal processing techniques** for SBSP.

They provided a foundation before conducting **CST Studio simulations** and **real anechoic chamber experiments** with **LabVIEW/GNU Radio-based software-defined radios**, validating these techniques for **wireless power transmission**.

This work strengthened my **Python programming skills**, particularly in numerical computing, data visualization, and signal processing. I applied **NumPy** for signal processing, **Matplotlib** for analyzing beamforming patterns, and implemented phase conjugation and least squares fitting techniques.
